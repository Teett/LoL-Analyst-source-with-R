# LoL-Analyst-source-with-R 
This is a repository for my work as a League of Legends Analyst using R stats and the Riot Games API, feel free to check my code, ask questions and suggest improvements.

I'll focus mainly on the libraries in the tidyverse and meaningful plotting with ggplot2 for real insight in League matches.
