# LoL-Analyst-source-with-R 
This is a repository of some of the work made as a League of Legends Analyst using R stats and the Riot Games API, feel free to check my code, ask questions and suggest improvements.

The idea of this repository is to provide useful insight that can contribute to the improvement of an esports team, making use of the information many teams don't have at hand because the data is too big to handle.
